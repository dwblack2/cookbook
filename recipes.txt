Preparation
   * Whisk together the coconut milk, ginger, garlic, turmeric, red-pepper flakes, honey and ½ teaspoon salt. Zest and juice ½ lime directly into the coconut milk mixture. Stir in ⅛ cup chopped cilantro. Add the fish fillets and turn to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes.
   * Meanwhile, adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position. Arrange another rack in the position closest to the broiler heat source. Heat oven to 425 degrees.
   * Place the tomatoes on a large sheet pan. Drizzle with 1 tbsp olive oil, season with salt and toss to coat. Place the marinated fish between the tomatoes and spoon all the marinade from the bowl over the fish. Drizzle ½ tablespoon of oil over the fish. Transfer the pan to the lower-middle rack and roast until the surface of the fish is opaque but the center is not cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes, depending on thickness of the fish. The fish should not flake easily with a fork. Remove the pan from the oven and heat the broiler to high.
   * Move the pan to the broiler and finish cooking, rotating the pan once, until the fish is tender and the tomatoes are just beginning to brown in spots, 5 to 6 minutes, depending on thickness of the fish. Slice the remaining lime into wedges.
   * Plate & garnish with the remaining ¼ cup cilantro and serve with lime wedges for squeezing.

Preparation
            * Make the blackening seasoning: In a small bowl, combine the salt, smoked paprika, thyme, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, mustard powder and cayenne.
            * Carefully slice the chicken breasts horizontally in half, then pat dry with a paper towel. Thoroughly coat all sides with the blackening seasoning and set aside.
            * Drizzle oil into a large skillet or cast iron pan over medium-high. When the oil begins to shimmer, carefully place the chicken in the pan and cook undisturbed for 5 minutes. Watch out for any oil splattering and popping out of the pan. Cook until the seasoning literally darkens. After 5 minutes, flip the chicken and cook for another 3 minutes.
            * Turn off the heat and leave the pan tented with aluminum foil for 5 minutes (this will help the chicken continue cooking from the residual heat without drying out). Remove the foil, then let the chicken rest for at least 2 minutes.
            * When ready to serve, slice the chicken on a bias into ½-inch pieces. Serve immediately.

Transfer chiles, spices and cooking liquid to the jar of a blender (or use an immersion blender) and puree until the salsa is completely smooth.
               * Meanwhile, cook the chicken. Place chicken thighs on a large platter and pat dry with paper towels. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add the chicken and cook until just turning golden brown on both sides, 7 to 9 minutes. Transfer to the same platter.
               * Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil to the same skillet (no need to clean it out), and cook the pineapple, onion, garlic and 2 teaspoons salt, tossing occasionally, until tender and just beginning to brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Nestle the chicken into the pan with the pineapple and pour the salsa over. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook until the chicken is tender and cooked through and the salsa has darkened and melded with the chicken and onions, about 10 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board, slice into strips and return to the skillet with the pineapple.
               * To serve, arrange a few pieces of chicken, pineapple and some salsa on each corn tortilla and top with avocado, cilantro and a squeeze of lime.

                        * Salad
                        * 1 lb sweet potatoes, butternut squash or carrots, peeled and cut into ¾-inch pieces (about 4 cups)

Preparation
                        * Preheat oven to 375
                        * Prepare the sweet potatoes: On a baking sheet, toss the sweet potatoes with the olive oil and a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Roast, stirring occasionally, 15 to 25 minutes.
                        * Cook lentils according to instructions. Drain the lentils then return them to the pot.

                        * Pour the hot browned butter and all of the toasty bits over the sage; it will crackle and foam a bit. Let the mixture sit for 1 minute to let the foam subside, then whisk in the olive oil, followed by the red wine vinegar and maple syrup. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
                        * Add the cooked sweet potatoes to the pot with the warm lentils. Pour the dressing over the top and stir gently to combine. Add the parsley, season with more salt and pepper, if desired, and toss to combine.
                        * Transfer the mixture to a serving dish and sprinkle with goat cheese, if using. Serve warm.

Preparation
                        * Melt butter in a large heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Stir in onion and ½ teaspoon salt; cook until golden and browned around the edges, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. (Don’t be tempted to turn the heat up to medium-high; keeping the heat on medium ensures even browning without burning the butter.)
                        * Stir in garlic and ginger, and cook another 1 minute. Stir in cumin, paprika, garam masala and cinnamon stick, and cook another 30 seconds.
                        * Add tomatoes with their juices. Using a large spoon or flat spatula, break up and smash the tomatoes in the pot (or you can use a pair of kitchen shears to cut the tomatoes while they are still in the can). Stir in coconut milk and the remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a simmer, and continue to cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, and continuing to mash up the tomatoes if necessary to help them break down.
                        * Stir in chickpeas and a pinch of cayenne if you like. Bring the pot back up to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, for another 10 minutes. Taste and add more salt if necessary.
                        * Serve spooned over white rice, and topped with cilantro.

                           * 4-5 stems of cilantro
                           * Pinch of salt

                           * Dinner 
                           * Stove 
Preparation
                           * Peel 5 cloves of garlic. Set 2 cloves aside for the pesto, then mince the other 3.
                           * Add olive oil to a pan on medium heat (see notes for oil-free). Add the minced garlic, keeping an eye on it and stirring occasionally.
                           * To a blender, add sundried tomatoes & pesto. Blend until smooth and creamy (see notes on what type of blender I like using for creamy sauces like this one!), adding 1-2 tbsp more water if needed.
                           * Drain and rinse a can of chickpeas. As the garlic starts to turn golden, add the chickpeas to the pan (stand back slightly from the pan to avoid burning yourself, as the chickpeas are slightly wet).
                           * Add the pesto to the chickpeas and mix well.
                           * Prepare the cilantro lime sauce by mixing together plant-based yogurt, lime juice, garlic powder, and salt. Roughly chop cilantro, then mix into the sauce.
                           * Remove the chickpeas from heat and stuff them into pita halves. Optionally, you can fry the pitas in a non-stick frying pan to get them slightly crunchy on the outside.
                           * Serve the pitas with the cilantro lime sauce

Preparation
                              * Heat the oven to 425 degrees. In a large bowl, toss the brussels sprouts, green beans and peppers with 2 tablespoons oil. Spread the vegetables out in a single layer on a large sheet pan. (Reserve the bowl.) Roast for 25 to 30 minutes, until the brussels sprouts are tender.
                              * Meanwhile, in a medium bowl or jar, combine the lime juice, fish sauce, chile-garlic sauce and garlic.

Turn rice over and press down again. Cook until golden on other side, occasionally pressing down, another 3 minutes. Transfer to a large paper towel-lined plate. Let cool slightly. In the reserved bowl, toss the roasted vegetables with the dressing and red onion. Break up the clumps of rice and add to the bowl along with the cilantro and mint. Toss to combine, then serve immediately.To make ahead, you can prepare and refrigerate the dressing up to 4 days ahead, and roast the vegetables up to 2 hours before serving (keeping them at room temperature).

                                    * Place the same large pot over medium heat, and add sesame oil, ginger, and garlic. Stir and cook for 30 seconds, until aromatic. Add turmeric, and stir for 15 seconds, until fragrant.
                                    * Pour the vegetable stock into the pot, then season with 1 teaspoon of salt. Cover and cook for 8 to 10 minutes on medium heat, to allow flavors to meld.
                                    * Remove the lid and add the miso paste, stirring constantly until it is dissolved. Taste, and season with more salt, if needed.
                                    * Increase the heat to medium-high, and carefully drop the dumplings into the broth. When they float to the top, add the baby bok choy and broccoli, and cook for about 2 minutes, just until the broccoli is crisp-tender.
                                    * Ladle the broth, dumplings, baby bok choy and broccoli into the four bowls over the noodles. To serve, top with cilantro or chopped scallions.

Preparation
                                    * Prepare the sauce: Place the peanut butter, garlic and hot water into a medium bowl and whisk well to combine. (If the peanut butter separates and looks curdled, that’s OK. It will come back together after you add the other seasonings.) Add the soy sauce, rice vinegar, sugar and chile crisp and whisk again until smooth and well combined. (It may look runny, but it will thicken up as it sits.)
                                    * Prepare the salad: Cut the cucumbers in half lengthwise and then into 2-inch lengths. Lay them cut side-down on a cutting board and, using the flat side of a chef’s knife or a rolling pin, smack the cucumbers until they break apart. Tear or cut them into bite-size pieces, if necessary.
                                    * Place the cucumbers in a colander and sprinkle with a pinch or 2 of salt. Allow to sit for 10 minutes to draw out excess moisture.
                                    * Meanwhile, heat a large (12-inch) nonstick or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over medium-high for 1 to 2 minutes, until very hot. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of oil and, working in batches, add the dumplings, flat-side down, and cook until the bottoms are lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes.
                                    * Carefully add about ¼ cup of water to the pan, just enough to cover the base of the dumplings, then immediately cover and cook until the water has evaporated, 3 to 4 minutes. (If your dumplings contain meat, cook for an extra 1 to 2 minutes, or according to package instructions.) Transfer the cooked dumplings to a plate and continue cooking the remaining dumplings. (If you prefer to steam the dumplings, see Tip.)
                                    * To serve, divide the dumplings among 4 plates or shallow bowls and top with the cucumbers. Spoon over a generous amount of peanut sauce, top with cilantro, sesame seeds or peanuts and a few drops of chile crisp/oil. Serve right away, while the dumplings are still warm, or at room temperature.

                                                      * Stove 
Preparation
                                                      * Start by cutting the tofu into lengthwise pieces about 1cm thick.
                                                      * Fry the tofu pieces on medium heat in a non-stick frying pan with a bit of oil. Fry for a few minutes on each side until golden.
                                                      * Prepare all of the vegetables by thinly slicing peppers, cutting carrots lengthwise into small sticks, and thinly slicing red cabbage and cucumber. Wash and dry the mint leaves (I used about 3-4 per roll).
                                                      * In a small jar, mix together nut butter of choice (I used almond, but you could use peanut butter or any other nut butter!), soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, maple syrup, water (starting with 1 tbsp and adding more if needed), garlic and ginger powder. Close the jar then shake until well combined.
                                                      * Once the tofu is fried, remove from heat and set aside.
                                                      * To a shallow bowl or large plate, add a bit of water (this will be used to dip the rice paper sheets).
                                                      * Start assembling the rolls. Dip a rice paper sheet in water for 5 seconds, then place on a cutting board to assemble. Add 3-4 mint leaves to the middle of the rice paper sheet, then a sprinkle of sesame seeds, then about 3 thin pieces of each veggie (cucumber, red pepper, yellow pepper, carrot, red cabbage) and 1-2 tofu pieces to the middle of the rice paper. Fold in the sides, then tightly roll.

Preparation
                                                         * Heat the oven to 300 degrees with racks in the upper and lower thirds. On a sheet pan, stir together the chickpeas, ⅔ cup olive oil, tomatoes, cinnamon, marjoram sprigs and 2 tablespoons chopped ginger. Season with salt and pepper and spread in an even layer.
                                                         * Scrub the squash — the skin is perfectly edible — and prick the squash in a few places with a paring knife. Transfer to an oven-safe skillet, baking dish or a second sheet pan (line with foil for easier clean-up) and coat lightly with oil, salt and pepper.
                                                         * Bake the squash on the bottom rack and the chickpeas on the upper rack until a knife slides easily through the squash and the chickpeas and tomatoes are dark red and thick like jam, 2 to 2½ hours, stirring the chickpeas occasionally.
                                                         * Meanwhile, stir the remaining ½ tablespoon ginger into the yogurt. Stir in water until thin enough to drizzle, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
                                                         * Discard the herb sprigs, then season the chickpeas to taste with salt and pepper. When the squash are cool enough to handle, cut or tear into big pieces, then scoop out and discard the stems, seeds and stringy bits. Season the squash with salt and pepper. Transfer the squash to a platter flesh side up, then top with the chickpeas, some of the ginger yogurt and a sprinkle of marjoram leaves. Serve the remaining yogurt alongside.

Preparation
                                                                     * Preheat to 425 degrees.
                                                                     * As the oven heats, halve potatoes lengthwise (quarter and cut any larger ones). Halve the onion lengthwise and cut each half into quarters. Transfer potatoes and onion to a sheet pan, add the ghee and season with 1½ tsp salt. Transfer to oven, and roast for 10 minutes while you prepare the marinade.
                                                                     * Make the marinade: Using a blender, mini food processor or immersion blender, combine the yogurt, cilantro, garlic, ginger, chiles, ghee, garam masala and 1½ tsp salt. Blend until the mixture is mostly smooth. If needed, add a tablespoon of water to help the blender along. Transfer the marinade to a medium bowl or resealable bag, and add the chicken. Massage marinade into chicken and let marinate while the potatoes cook.
                                                                     * Roast veggies 10 minutes, then remove the pan from the oven and nestle chicken on top, skin side up, scraping any excess marinade from the chicken skin onto the vegetables. Return sheet pan to the oven and adjust heat to 450 degrees. Roast 30-35 minutes. 
                                                                     * Transfer chicken to a plate. Add the lemon juice, cream and 3 tbsp hot water to the sheet pan and toss with a metal spatula, scraping up any browned bits, until the potatoes are coated in sauce. Transfer chicken back over top and serve. Garnish with cilantro.

Preparation
                                                                                          * Sift flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt into a bowl. Set aside.
                                                                                          * Using a mixer fitted with paddle attachment, cream butter and sugars together until very light, about 5 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla. Reduce speed to low, add dry ingredients and mix until just combined, 5 to 10 seconds. Drop chocolate pieces in and incorporate them without breaking them. Press plastic wrap against dough and refrigerate for 24 to 36 hours. Dough may be used in batches, and can be refrigerated for up to 72 hours.
                                                                                          * When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat. Set aside.
                                                                                          * Scoop 6 3½-ounce mounds of dough (the size of generous golf balls) onto baking sheet, making sure to turn horizontally any chocolate pieces that are poking up; it will make for a more attractive cookie. Sprinkle lightly with sea salt and bake until golden brown but still soft, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer sheet to a wire rack for 10 minutes, then slip cookies onto another rack to cool a bit more. Repeat with remaining dough, or reserve dough, refrigerated, for baking remaining batches the next day. Eat warm, with a big napkin.

                                                                                             * Baked 
Preparation
                                                                                             * Heat oven to 375 degrees. Line a standard 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners or generously grease. Either way, be sure to coat the top of the tin with butter or nonstick cooking spray to easily remove the muffin tops.
                                                                                             * In a large bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.
                                                                                             * Add sugar to a medium bowl, and zest the lemon directly into the sugar. Rub together until the sugar is pale yellow. Squeeze in 2 tablespoons lemon juice, then add the yogurt, oil and eggs. Whisk until very smooth.
                                                                                             * Toss the blueberries into the dry mixture until evenly coated, then add the wet ingredients and stir gently just until no traces of flour remain. It’s OK if the batter is lumpy.
                                                                                             * Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups.
                                                                                             * Bake until golden brown on top, about 20 minutes. When you press the top of a muffin, it should almost feel like a soft pillow.
                                                                                             * Cool for at least 5 minutes before removing from the tin. Completely cooled muffins can be frozen in an airtight container for up to 2 months. Thaw fully, then reheat in a toaster oven before enjoying.

                                                                                             *  ½ teaspoon baking soda
                                                                                             * ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon

                                                                                             * Baked 
Preparation 
                                                                                             * Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and line an 8-by-8-inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on two sides.
                                                                                             * In a large bowl, whisk together the butter, pumpkin purée, sugars, egg yolk and vanilla extract. Fold in the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, salt and most of the chocolate and pecans. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan, smooth into an even layer and sprinkle the top with the remaining chocolate and pecans.
                                                                                             * Bake until the top looks dry and set and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with moist crumbs attached, 25 to 35 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. Transfer to a rack to cool completely.
                                                                                             * To serve, use the paper overhang to transfer the blondies to a cutting board. Cut into 16 pieces. Store at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 3 days, or in the freezer for up to 1 month.
